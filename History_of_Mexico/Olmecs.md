> The **Olmecs** or Olmec were an early major Mesoamerican civilization, 
> flourishing in the modern-day Mexican states of Veracruz and Tabasco 
> from roughly 1200 to 400 BC during Mesoamerica's formative period. 
> 
> They were initially centered at the site of their development in San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, 
> but moved to La Venta in the 10th century BC following the decline of San Lorenzo. 
> 
> By about 400 BC the major centres of the Olmec civilization had been abandoned, 
> and the population of the eastern half of the Olmec heartland dropped precipitously. The settlement density in that area remained much lower than during the height of Olmec dominance, and only intermittent occupation is evident until much later. Although the Olmec cultural style waned, elements of their tradition lived on in successor societies.
>
> Among other "firsts", the Olmec appeared to practice ritual bloodletting and played the Mesoamerican ballgame, hallmarks of nearly all subsequent Mesoamerican societies. The aspect of the Olmecs most familiar now is their artwork, particularly the colossal heads. The Olmec civilization was first defined through artifacts which collectors purchased on the pre-Columbian art market in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Olmec artworks are considered among ancient America's most striking.
