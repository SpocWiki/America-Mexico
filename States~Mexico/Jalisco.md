> **Jalisco**, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Jalisco, is one of the 31 states which, 
> along with Mexico City, comprise the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico. 
> 
> It is located in western Mexico and is bordered by six states, 
> Nayarit, Zacatecas, Aguascalientes, Guanajuato, Michoacán, and Colima. 
> Jalisco is divided into 125 municipalities, and its capital and largest city is Guadalajara.
>
> Jalisco is one of the most economically and culturally important states in Mexico, 
> owing to its natural resources as well as its long history and culture. 
> 
> Many of the characteristic traits of Mexican culture are originally from Jalisco, 
> such as mariachi, tequila, ranchera music, birria, and jaripeo, hence the state's motto: 
> Jalisco es México ('Jalisco is Mexico').  
> Economically, it is ranked third in the country, 
> with industries centered in the Guadalajara metropolitan area, 
> the third largest metropolitan area in Mexico.
>
> The state is home to two significant indigenous populations, the Huichols and the Nahuas. 
> There is also a significant foreign population, mostly from the United States and Canada, 
> living in the Lake Chapala and Puerto Vallarta areas.
